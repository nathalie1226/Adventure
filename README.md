# Adventure
Remember the old books, where you had to choose what the character does next? In this game, you will
create a storyline for an adventure. Each choice your user makes in the story will move it in a different
direction.
The template was given to us by our Israel Tech Challenge teacher's.
The task was to :
Create a flow chart for the user interaction, Plan the database and also Write the storyline .
